colorgram.py
============

**colorgram.py** is a Python library that lets you extract colors from images. Compared to other libraries, the colorgram algorithm's results are more intense.

colorgram.py is a port of `colorgram.js <https://github.com/darosh/colorgram-js>`__, a JavaScript library written by GitHub user `@darosh <https://github.com/darosh>`__. The goal is to have 100% accuracy to the results of the original library (a goal that is met). I decided to port it since I much prefer the results the colorgram algorithm gets over those of alternative libraries - have a look in the next section.

Results

    :alt: Results of colorgram.py on a 512x512 image

Time-wise, an extraction of a 512x512 image takes about 0.66s (another popular color extraction library, `Color Thief <https://github.com/fengsp/color-thief-py>`__, takes about 1.05s).


Installation
------------
You can install colorgram.py with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/>`__, as following:

::

    pip install colorgram.py

How to use
----------

Using colorgram.py is simple. Mainly there's only one function you'll need to use - ``colorgram.extract``.

Example
'''''''

.. code:: python

    import colorgram

    # Extract 6 colors from an image.
    colors = colorgram.extract('sweet_pic.jpg', 6)

    # colorgram.extract returns Color objects, which let you access
    # RGB, HSL, and what proportion of the image was that color.
    first_color = colors[0]
    rgb = first_color.rgb # e.g. (255, 151, 210)
    hsl = first_color.hsl # e.g. (230, 255, 203)
    proportion  = first_color.proportion # e.g. 0.34

    # RGB and HSL are named tuples, so values can be accessed as properties.
    # These all work just as well:
    red = rgb[0]
    red = rgb.r
    saturation = hsl[1]
    saturation = hsl.s

``colorgram.extract(image, number_of_colors)``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Extract colors from an image. ``image`` may be either a path to a file, a file-like object, or a Pillow ``Image`` object. The function will return a list of ``number_of_colors`` ``Color`` objects.

``colorgram.Color``
'''''''''''''''''''
A color extracted from an image. Its properties are:

* ``Color.rgb`` - The color represented as a ``namedtuple`` of RGB from 0 to 255, e.g. ``(r=255, g=151, b=210)``.
* ``Color.hsl`` - The color represented as a ``namedtuple`` of HSL from 0 to 255, e.g. ``(h=230, s=255, l=203)``.
* ``Color.proportion`` - The proportion of the image that is in the extracted color from 0 to 1, e.g. ``0.34``.

Sorting by HSL
''''''''''''''
Something the original library lets you do is sort the colors you get by HSL. In actuality, though, the colors are only sorted by hue (as of colorgram.js 0.1.5), while saturation and lightness are ignored. To get the corresponding result in colorgram.py, simply do:

.. code:: python

    colors.sort(key=lambda c: c.hsl.h)
    # or...
    sorted(colors, key=lambda c: c.hsl.h)

Performance
-----------
Performance can be boosted with usage of `Cython <https://cython.org>`__ dependency. When Cython discovered would automatically switch on more efficient C-version of project.

**Benchmark conditions:**

* machine: Mac OS Catalina, Intel Core i5 3.4 GHz
* image: `tests/test.png`

**Benchmark code:**

.. code:: python

    import timeit
    import statistics  # Python 2.7: pip install statistics

    _setup = '''
    from PIL import Image
    num_colors = 6
    img = Image.open('data/test.png')
    img.load()
    '''

    _code = '''
    import colorgram
    colorgram.extract(img, num_colors)
    '''
    number = 20
    repeats = 10
    measures = timeit.repeat(setup=_setup, stmt=_code, number=number, repeat=repeats)

    _mean = statistics.mean(measures) / number
    _stdev = statistics.stdev(measures) / number

    print('results: %0.6f (+/- %0.6f) sec.' % (_mean, _stdev))


**Benchmark results:**

* results: 0.402446 (+/- 0.003126) sec. (Python 2.7.6, Pillow 6.2.2)
* results: 0.081205 (+/- 0.003234) sec. (Python 2.7.6, Pillow 6.2.2, Cython) ~ 4.95 faster
* results: 0.553765 (+/- 0.002030) sec. (Python 3.6.8, Pillow 8.0.1)
* results: 0.108687 (+/- 0.011445) sec. (Python 3.6.8, Pillow 8.0.1, Cython) ~ 5.09 faster
